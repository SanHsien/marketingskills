Marketing skills for AI agents: conversion optimization, copywriting, SEO, analytics, and growth engineering. Works with Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, Cursor, Windsurf, and any agent that supports the [Agent Skills spec](https://agentskills.io).

> **This is a Windows-first maintenance fork of [`coreyhaines31/marketingskills`](https://github.com/coreyhaines31/marketingskills).** It keeps the MIT license and full git history. Product behaviour follows upstream; this line adds Traditional Chinese docs, a Windows development gate, and commit-by-commit upstream review. See [`FORK.md`](FORK.md) and [`docs/UPSTREAM.md`](docs/UPSTREAM.md).

## How skills work together

The `product-marketing` skill is the foundation — every other skill checks it first to understand your product, audience, and positioning.

See each skill's **Related Skills** section for the full dependency map.

## Available skills

This repository currently ships **50** product skills. The descriptions below are upstream trigger phrases used for discovery.

## Install the skills

Copy the product directories under `skills/` into an Agent Skills folder. Do not copy `docs/`, `tests/`, or this fork's Python/PowerShell maintenance tools.

Typical locations: `~/.agents/skills/`, `~/.claude/skills/`, or `~/.cursor/skills/`.

```powershell
npx skills add SanHsien/marketingskills
npx skills add SanHsien/marketingskills --skill cro copywriting
```

Claude Code plugin:

```text
/plugin marketplace add SanHsien/marketingskills
/plugin install marketing-skills
```

Maintainer setup (Windows):

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/SanHsien/marketingskills.git
cd marketingskills
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\python -m pip install --upgrade pip
.venv\Scripts\python -m pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
pwsh -NoProfile -File tools\dev_check.ps1
```

```text
"Help me optimize this landing page for conversions"
→ Uses cro

"Write homepage copy for my SaaS"
→ Uses copywriting

```

You can also invoke skills directly: `/cro`, `/emails`, `/seo-audit`.
